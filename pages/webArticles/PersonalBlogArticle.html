                    This project began in July 2025 to immerse myself in the fundamentals of website development. From both a technical perspective – using HTML 5, CSS, and JavaScript – and a UX perspective, resulting in a presentable and easy to use site at any window size. Additionally, Trello and Git were used as tools to support the development. The key learnings from this project are:

                    The project was created so that unnecessary features (at the time of writing) have the infrastructure required to make implementation easy further down the line.

                    This section’s main purpose is to put the project in its proper context. It’s primarily anecdotal. The sections that follow this one goes into more technical detail.

                    The idea to create a website began with the rediscovery of an old book that taught the fundamentals of web design. After reading through the book and following through with each of the exercises I began to work on another project. However, as soon as I began to work in the way that they taught me, the syntax to do the simplest things were convoluted and it seemed that there must be a simpler way. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I looked for online resources and found MDN docs. After browsing through the materials, it appeared to have a higher overall quality than the book. From around May to July after my shifts I would take notes and follow along with the provided exercises and quizzes. Finally in late July I had learned the bare necessities and began work on this website.

            <h2>Flexboxes and Design</h2>
            <div class="pageBody">
                <p>
                    The design that was settled on after some iteration ended up being almost entirely flexbox based. Flexboxes were used ubiquitously after I received some feedback on designs that used grids to present parallel information to my main text. 
                </p>
            </div>    
            <div class="imageBG">

            <div class="pageBody">
                <p>
                    Mostly what I removed was the gallery section, which at the time only held an image I took when on a camping trip. At the time I had imagined the gallery would later turn into a carousal that would cycle between images I took or page updates. The feedback I received from a UX designer was that the images distracted from the main content on my site, which was supposed to be the project showcases. Thus, as the project matured, the need for the gallery, and thus grids diminished as the delivery of information was streamlined.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Flexbox displays excel at organizing child items along one dimension. They can be seen at work everywhere in the site, the navigation bar, project display, footer, and main content are all made of at least one flex container.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The greatest learning experience for conceptualizing how style rules affect elements, as well as the internal representation of the elements was creating the navigation bar. Given how flexboxes were presented, I found it intuitive to make the encapsulating 'ul' element a flexbox and set the 'li' to share an equal proportion of the available space. This distributes the space of the items equally along the horizontal axis however it did not ensure that text inside the flex items were distributed equally along the cross axis because the flex rules only apply to the flex containers immediate children by default. The solution to the problem was to nest flex containers inside each other and align their content centrally.
                </p>

                    One of the most engaging aspects of the project was designing the layout of each page type, in addition to adding subtle effects to the page to enhance its appeal. Before I implemented any design, I always sketched it out first to get a feel for it. Elements would be annotated it with explanations for certain behaviours if it was warranted.
                </p>

            <div class="pageBody">

                    The component that went through the most iterations were the article cards on the home page. Sometimes they were vertically oriented cards, other times they were horizontal. Both designs ended up being used in the final design as they suited different screen widths better. Try playing with the size of the viewport to see it!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another satisfying part of the design process was adding small, and little effects to the elements with what ended up being simple CSS. The navigation buttons changing to the secondary blue colour when hovered over by the mouse is particularly satisfying to me. My favourite though is the hover effect over the project articles. A slight gray shadow will surround the border of the card, in addition to the image being scaled by a factor of 1.05. It is a subtle effect and is hardly noticeable but makes it feel fun to be on the site.

            <h2>DOM manipulation</h2>
            <div class="pageBody">
                <p >
                    The site presents as static, but just beneath the surface JavaScript is responsible for inserting most of the content you see. All the banner, nav, and footer sections are appended when the page loads. The articles in the ‘projects’ section on the index page are also dynamic but is more complicated than the other injected content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the DOM for any page on the site is finished constructing the ‘main.js’ module is called. This script searches the page is called on for specific CSS classes and on the first match found, appends some HTML with the proper tags. The reason for doing this dynamically is to improve the maintainability of the site. I found that as soon as I began working on multiple pages at a time, there were many common elements that I would want to transfer over. This could be done easily with a quick copy and paste, but this solution both bloats the code base and is error prone. For example, if I found a bug in one of the common elements, I would need to manually update the text for each page that contains it. This is generally tedious and could result in the fixes not being applied to all pages if one wasn’t updated or was updated incorrectly. Another bonus to having the html written in one shared JavaScript is the opportunity to dynamically change a resource depending on the sites state in code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reason for the post being dynamically created and added to the homepage upon loading is not as practical as for the core elements described before. Instead, it was because I thought it would be cool if the page retrieved information from a JSON file and was formatted into an easily digestible card. Being able to retrieval a store of information and representing it in memory would allow for user sorting, automatic content formatting, and mimics ‘data driven’ designs in a very simple way which seemed like an interesting challenge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once I established the things that I wanted to define the systems state I began working on retrieving the JSON document. Because the function dedicated to loading the articles requires the cards to exist, the method that retrieves them in the first place had to have fulfilled its promise to proceed with the rest of the functionality. As a result, this is a fairly simple use for concurrent processing that acts like a sequential process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once I finished my first experiment with async methods in JS I began creating the driver function for the ‘managePosts’ script. At this point when I called the called loadJson I began to run into errors caused by a race condition. LoadJson was an async function and was awaited inside the calling function, so I was confused by the fact all my data was returning null. It turns out the issue was caused by the Fetch call inside the loadJson method was returning an empty promise immediately (as async functions do) which caused the driver function to carry on with the rest of its responsibilities under the false assumption that the data was already in memory. This was easily fixed by adding another await inside loadJson.

                    Creating this website and learning the essentials for front-end web development, the blend of technical expertise and creativity, made for a rewarding project on many fronts. The final form of this project is perfect for the scale its operating at but has the underlying infrastructure to offer improved functionality easily. Looking to the future, it might be worthwhile to refactor the post system to take advantage of a client-side framework like react, in addition to updating the site with in-depth project articles.
