                    This project began in July 2025 to immerse myself in the fundamentals of website development. From both a technical perspective – using HTML 5, CSS, and JavaScript – and a UX perspective, resulting in a presentable and easy to use site at any window size. Additionally, Trello and Git were used as tools to support the development. The key learnings from this project are:

                <ul>
                    <li><span>Uses of DOM manipulation using JavaScript</span></li>
                    <li><span>How to use Flexboxes, Grids, and media queries to create responsive designs</span></li>
                    <li><span>Promise handling and how to read JSON files</span></li>
                    <li><span>The fundamentals of good visual design</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The project was created so that unnecessary features (at the time of writing) have the infrastructure required to make implementation easy further down the line.

                    This section’s main purpose is to put the project in its proper context. It’s primarily anecdotal. The sections that follow this one goes into more technical detail.

                    The idea to create a website began with the rediscovery of an old book that taught the fundamentals of web design. After reading through the book and following through with each of the exercises I began to work on another project. However, as soon as I began to work in the way that they taught me, the syntax to do the simplest things were convoluted and it seemed that there must be a simpler way. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I looked for online resources and found MDN docs. After browsing through the materials, it appeared to have a higher overall quality than the book. From around May to July after my shifts I would take notes and follow along with the provided exercises and quizzes. Finally in late July I had learned the bare necessities and began work on this website.
