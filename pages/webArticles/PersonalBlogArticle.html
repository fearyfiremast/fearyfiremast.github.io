                    What became this portfolio began creation in July 2025 and existed as a way to reinforce the fundamentals of website development. Enhancing both technical – HTML 5, CSS, and JavaScript – and UX skills. The results are a presentable and easy to use site at any window size. The key learnings from this project are:

                <p>
                    The idea to create a website began with the rediscovery of an old book that taught the fundamentals of web design. After reading through the book and following through with each of the exercises I began to work on another project. However, as soon as I began to work in the way that they taught me, the syntax to do the simplest things were convoluted and it seemed that there must be a simpler way.                 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I looked for resources online and found MDN docs. After browsing through the materials, it appeared to have a higher overall quality than the book. From around May to July after my shifts I would take notes and follow along with the provided exercises and quizzes. Finally in late July I had learned the bare necessities and began work on this website.

                    Each significant component of the website for this iteration of the project was implemented with flexbox displays. Their ubiquity came after I received some feedback on designs that used grids to present parallel information to my main text. Presenting information along a single axis helps it stand out.

                    The greatest learning experience for conceptualizing how style rules affect elements was creating the navigation bar. Given how flexboxes were presented, I found it intuitive to make the encapsulating ‘ul’ element a flexbox and set the ‘li’ child to share an equal proportion of the available space. This distributes space among the flex items equally along the main axis (in this case horizontally). However, it did not ensure that text inside the flex items were distributed equally along the cross axis because the flex rules only apply to the flex containers immediate children. The solution to the problem was to nest flex containers inside each other and align their content centrally.                
                </p>

                    One of the most engaging aspects of the project was designing the layout of each page type, as well as adding subtle effects to the page to enhance its appeal. Before I implemented any design, I always sketched it out first to get a feel for it. Elements would be annotated it with explanations for certain behaviours if it was warranted.                
                </p>

            <div class="pageBody">

                    The component that went through the most iterations were the article cards on the home page. Sometimes they were vertically oriented cards, other times they were horizontal. Both designs ended up being used in the final design as they suited different screen widths better. Try playing with the size of the viewport to see it!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another satisfying part of the design process was adding small scale effects to the elements with simple CSS and its pseudo-classes. The navigation buttons changing to the secondary blue colour when hovered over by the mouse is particularly satisfying to me. My favourite though is the hover effect over the project articles. A slight gray shadow will surround the border of the card, in addition to the image being scaled by a factor of 1.05. It is a subtle effect and is hardly noticeable but makes it fun to interact with the site.

            <h2>DOM manipulation</h2>
            <div class="pageBody">
                <p >
                    The site presents as static, but just beneath the surface JavaScript is responsible for inserting most of the content you see. All the banner, nav, and footer sections are appended when the page loads. The articles in the ‘projects’ section on the index page are also dynamic but is more complicated than the other injected content.                
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the DOM for any page on the site is finished constructing the ‘main.js’ module is called. This script searches the page for specific CSS classes and appends some HTML. The reason for doing this dynamically is to improve the maintainability of the site. I found that as soon as I began working on multiple pages, there were many common elements that I would want to transfer over. This could be done easily with a quick copy and paste, but this solution both bloats the code base and is error prone. For example, if I found a bug in one of the common elements, I would need to manually update the text for each page that contains it. This is a tedious process and could result in the fixes not being applied to all pages if one was missed or updated incorrectly. Another bonus to having the HTML written in one shared module is the opportunity to dynamically change a resource depending on the sites state in code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reason for the post being dynamically created and added to the homepage upon loading is not as practical as for the core elements described before. Instead, it was implemented because I thought it would be cool if the page retrieved information from a JSON file and was formatted into an easily digestible card. Being able to retrieval a store of information and representing it in memory could allow for user sorting, automatic content formatting, and mimics ‘data driven’ designs in a very simple way. Most of the described features are not currently implemented, but with the fundamental mechanism in place most of the work is already done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once I established the attributes that I wanted to define the systems state I began working on retrieving the JSON document. Because the function dedicated to loading and then appending the cards onto the site, it was essential that raw JSON was loaded into memory. A method was created to retrieve the data if it found that they did not exist. Because I used fetch API to retrieve the data both the highest level function, and the method introduced to gather the data needed to be asynchronous so I could halt execution until the promise was fulfilled.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this point when I called the called loadJson() I began to run into errors caused by a race condition. LoadJson() was being called with the await keyword, so I assumed once it returned it was guaranteed to have the information from the targeted file. Unfortunately, on the first draft of the process I did not consider that because the fetch chain I was using was also async it would return an unfulfilled promise immediately while concurrently it continued processing the request. Once I realized this quirk of the behavior I awaited the fetch chain inside loadJson() and the issue was resolved.

                    Creating this website, learning the essentials for front-end web development, the blend of technical expertise and creativity, all made for a rewarding project on many fronts. The final form of this project is perfect for the scale its operating at but has the underlying infrastructure to increase functionality easily. Looking to the future, it might be worthwhile to refactor the post system to take advantage of a client-side framework like react, in addition to updating the site with in-depth project articles.
